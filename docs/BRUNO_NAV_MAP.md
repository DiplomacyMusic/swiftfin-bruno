# Bruno Navigation Map (tvOS)

> **How to read this.** This is the canonical map of every Bruno tvOS surface, the shelves on each,
> exactly what data each shelf draws from, and where its "Show all" lands. Use it to **de-dupe and
> streamline** content pages, shelf sources, and routing. "Lens/eyebrow" is the uppercased kicker over
> a shelf title. "Derived from" names the exact query/library/items source — trace it to the cited
> file. "Show-all destination" is the route the See-All/Show-all card pushes (and which filter it
> carries). Home shelves have **no Show-all** (browse-only feed); browse surfaces do. Section 4 is the
> bug list: every place a shelf's Show-all disagrees with the equivalent card/destination elsewhere.
>
> All paths are repo-relative to the Bruno root. tvOS-only unless noted.

## 1. Surface tree

Tab order (tvOS) — `Shared/Coordinators/Tabs/MainTabView.swift:38-44`, tabs defined in
`Shared/Coordinators/Tabs/TabItem.swift`:

```
Search        (utility, icon-only)  → stock SearchView + fixed brunoUtilityTabBar()        TabItem.swift:124
Home          (DEFAULT)             → BrunoHomeView                                          TabItem.swift:47
  └─ footer (at feed end): Show all Movies → brunoMoviesGrid · Show all TV → brunoTVGrid · Back to Top

```

All See-All / card-tap routing funnels through one function: `brunoRouteToShowAll(_:router:namespace:)`
(`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoCategoryCardRow.swift:62-168`), switching on
`BrunoCollectionCategory.drillStyle` (`.genres | .shelves | .items | .grid`). Both shelf headers
(`BrunoCategoryShelves.swift:433`) and gradient tiles (`BrunoCategoryCardRow.swift:41`) call it, so
they cannot diverge — except where the **inputs** differ (see §4).

---

## 2. Home (`BrunoHomeView`)

Engine: `Shared/Objects/Bruno/BrunoHomePlan.swift` (pure `build(seed:snapshot:now:)`, spine + explore
tail). View: `Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoHomeView.swift`; rows render via `BrunoShelfView`
→ `PosterHStack` (no per-shelf Show-all affordance). Spine cap `shelfCap = 18`; explore tail grows +2
per page across `exploreBlockCount = 3` blocks, hard ceiling `tailCeiling = 60`.

**Per-shelf max items = 18 (`shelfCap`)** unless noted. **Show-all = none for every Home shelf** (the
feed is terminal; drill-in lives only in the bottom footer, below).

### 2a. Spine (fixed order, contents reseed by seed)

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from | Max | Show-all | shelf/grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Continue Watching | Pick Up Where You Left Off | `source:.resume` (ResumeItemsLibrary, live user-state) | live | none | shelf |
| Up Next | Next Episode | `source:.nextUp` (NextUpLibrary, live) | live | none | shelf |
| Just Added | New to the Library | `source:.recentlyAdded` (RecentlyAddedLibrary, live; shows date) | live | none | shelf |
| {Year} & Around | A Year in Film | `yearShelf` — `BrunoQuery years=[year-2…year+2]`, seeded shuffle. 1st of 3 distinct seeded years | 18 | none | shelf |
| Spotlight on {Director} | Director Spotlight | `seededPick(directorBoxSets)` → `parentQuery(parentID, movie+series)` | 18 | none | shelf |
| {Genre} | If You Like | `seededPick(genres)` → `genreQuery` (years ≥ `modernCutoff` only) | 18 | none | shelf |
| Classic Romance | Vintage Hearts | Romance genre + years < `modernCutoff`; only if Romance genre + ≥2 vintage years | 18 | none | shelf |
| Series in the Library | Television | `BrunoQuery includeItemTypes=[.series]`, seeded shuffle | 18 | none | shelf |
| {Year} & Around | A Year in Film | 2nd distinct seeded year (mid-spine) | 18 | none | shelf |
| {Studio} | From the Vault | `seededPick(studioBoxSets)` → `parentQuery` | 18 | none | shelf |
| Eras | Browse by Decade | `.items(decadeBoxSets)`, portrait tiles; dropped if < `minItems`(3) | n/a | none | shelf (tiles) |
| Browse by Director | Auteurs | `.items(directorBoxSets.prefix(14))`, portrait tiles | 14 | none | shelf (tiles) |
| {Year} & Around | A Year in Film | 3rd distinct seeded year (pre-Collections) | 18 | none | shelf |
| Browse the Collection | Collections | `.items(favoriteGroupBoxSets, "genres" excluded)`, portrait tiles | n/a | none | shelf (tiles) |

Spine notes: adjacency rule drops any shelf whose `kind` equals the previous shelf's; content dedupe by
`dedupeKey` across the whole session; `year` is excluded from the explore pool so the tail never adds a
4th colliding year (`BrunoHomePlan.swift:42-46`).

### 2b. Explore tail (seeded generators, +2/page, reseeds per block)

Initial build appends up to 5 distinct keys; `appendExplore` walks `exploreKeys` per scroll page. Same
18-item cap, same "no Show-all" rule.

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from (`explore(key:)`, `BrunoHomePlan.swift:243-320`) | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acclaimed & Unwatched | Hidden Gems | `minCommunityRating≥8.1 & isUnplayed`, sort communityRating desc | 18 |
| Critics' Highest Rated | Top of the Library | `minCommunityRating≥7.5`, sort communityRating desc, `limit=15` | 15 |
| {Genre} | If You Like | `seededPick(genres)` → `genreQuery` (modern years; no salt) — distinct from spine | 18 |
| {Studio} | From the Vault | `boxSetShelf(studioBoxSets)` → `parentQuery` | 18 |
| Hidden in the {Decade} | Lost in Time | `boxSetShelf(decadeBoxSets)` → `parentQuery` | 18 |
| Spotlight on {Director} | Director Spotlight | `boxSetShelf(directorBoxSets)` → `parentQuery` (different salt than spine) | 18 |
| {Curated} | Curated | `boxSetShelf(curatedBoxSets)`, " — " stripped for display | 18 |
| {Seasonal} Picks | In Season | `seasonalShelf` — date-aware (Dec christmas / Oct halloween / Jul july), else seeded | 18 |

### 2c. Home terminal footer (renders only once `exploreExhausted`)

`BrunoHomeView.swift:177-202`. Re-surfaces the collection group cards then 3 pills.

| Element | Source | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Group cards | `BrunoCategoryCardRow(viewModel.collectionCategories)` | each via `brunoRouteToShowAll` (same as Collections tab — see §3) |
| Show all Movies | pill | `brunoMoviesGrid` → `BrunoMediaView(.movie)` A–Z |
| Show all TV | pill | `brunoTVGrid` → `BrunoMediaView(.series)` A–Z |
| Back to Top | pill | scroll to hero |

---

## 3. Collections (`BrunoCollectionsView` → `BrunoCategoryShelves`)

`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoCollectionsView.swift` + shared
`BrunoCategoryShelves.swift`. Category set from `BrunoCollectionCategory.fromSnapshot`
(`BrunoCategoryShelves.swift:134`) + appended synthetic "Boxed Sets". Fixed order via
`rank(for:)` (`:93`). One capped inline shelf per category; **inline preview cap = 14** but
`shelfItems(for:)` (`:454`) populates the **full** child set for `.grid`/`.items` box-set groups (the
row IS the full set there). "Genres" card is dropped (it moved to the Movies tab). Seasonal only
ranks in during the Halloween→Christmas window. Each header's "Show all" → `brunoRouteToShowAll`.

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from | Max items | Show-all destination (filter carried) | shelf/grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New Releases | Just Added | Flat group, no boxSet children, `showsDate=true` | 14 preview | `brunoBoxSetGrid(portrait, showsDate, newest-first)` — children sorted by premiereDate desc | shelf |
| Directors | Auteurs | Directors group's boxSet children; weighted preview (salt `0x91A3`) | 16 weighted (full set on Show-all) | `brunoBoxSetGrid(portrait, artCarousel)` — boxSet children only | shelf |
| Movie Stars | Movie Stars | Actor group boxSet children | full set | `brunoBoxSetGrid(portrait, artCarousel)` | shelf |
| Boxed Sets | Franchises | Franchise boxSets NOT in any curated group; weighted (salt `0xB075`) | 16 weighted | `brunoBoxSetGrid(landscape, collectionLabel)` — `category.children` (`.items`) | shelf |
| Decades | Through the Years | Decades group boxSet children; newest-first | 14 preview | `brunoCategoryShelves(parent: Decades)` → drill-in (§3a) | shelf |
| Curated | Hand-Picked | Curated group boxSet children | 14 preview | `brunoCategoryShelves(parent: Curated)` → drill-in (§3b) | shelf |
| Studios | From the Vault | Studios group boxSet children; weighted (salt `0x5747`) | 16 weighted | `brunoStudiosGrid(items)` — cinematic landscape grid | shelf |
| Seasonal | In Season | Seasonal group boxSet children (only Oct–Dec) | 14 preview | per `drillStyle(for:)` default `.grid` | shelf |

`drillStyle(for:)` (`BrunoCategoryShelves.swift:107`): Genres→`.genres`, Decades→`.shelves`,
Curated→`.shelves`, everything else→`.grid`. Boxed Sets is built explicitly as `.items`.

### 3a. Decades drill-in (`BrunoBoxSetShelvesView`, `isDecades==true`)

`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoBoxSetShelvesView.swift`. Pill row ("All" + each decade).
"All" shows one shelf per decade; selecting a decade pill swaps to per-year shelves
(`loadYearShelves` `:530`, debounced ~500 ms, memoized). Per-year built in `yearCategories` (`:575`).

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from | Max | Show-all destination (filter carried) | shelf/grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best of the {Decade} | (decade lens) | `bruno-sig:<NN>` tag, significance-desc; shown only if ≥8 tagged films | 15 | `.grid` `gridParent=decade, gridYear=nil` → `ItemLibrary(decade)` **unfiltered** — significance order is NOT carried | shelf |
| {Year} | A Year in Film | Per-year bucket of the decade's complete fetch, premiere-desc | all in year | `.grid` `gridParent=decade, gridYear=year` → `ItemLibrary(decade, years:[year])` — **year filter carried** | shelf |
| Other | (decade lens) | Out-of-window / yearless films | all | `.grid` `gridParent=decade, gridYear=nil` → `ItemLibrary(decade)` unfiltered | shelf |
| {Decade} (non-splittable, e.g. "1950s & Earlier") | — | Whole bucket as one grid | all | `ItemLibrary(decade)` unfiltered | shelf |

### 3b. Curated drill-in (`BrunoBoxSetShelvesView`, `isDecades==false` → card row)

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from | Max | Show-all destination | shelf/grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {Curated sub-collection} | Hand-Picked | Each curated group boxSet child (Oscar, Ebert, …); server order; weighted preview (salt `0xC0DE`) | 14 preview | `.grid` → `ItemLibrary(curated boxSet)` — no year filter | shelf |

---

## 4. Movies / Genres (`BrunoMoviesView` → `BrunoGenresView`)

`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoMoviesView.swift` resolves the "Genres" group boxSet from the
snapshot and hands it to `BrunoGenresView` (core-genre pills + a shelf per sub-genre). Genre categories
are `recencyBiased` → row is modern-only, Show-all grid sorts newest-first (pre-1985 sink to the
bottom). Sub-genre membership is the full set (no year filter, recency-biased), per-launch reshuffled,
6 lead genres pinned. Preview cap 14; ~80 sub-genres total. Trailing "All Movies" pill →
`brunoMoviesGrid`.

| Shelf | Lens/eyebrow | Derived from | Max | Show-all destination (filter carried) | shelf/grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {Sub-genre} | If You Like | Genre group boxSet child; weighted preview (salt `0xC0DE`) | 14 preview / full sub-genre on Show-all | `ItemLibrary(genre boxSet, sortBy:premiereDate desc)` — **recency sort carried** | shelf |
| — (tab footer) | — | — | — | trailing "All Movies" → `brunoMoviesGrid` → `BrunoMediaView(.movie)` | — |

Fallback: if no Genres group exists, the Movies tab renders `BrunoMediaView(.movie)` A–Z grid directly
(`BrunoMoviesView.swift:51`).

---

## 5. TV Shows (`BrunoMediaView`, GRID)

`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoMediaView.swift`, `itemType:.series`, `heroEyebrow:"Featured
Series"`. No shelves.

| Surface | Derived from | Max | Destination |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GRID** — All TV Shows | `Paths.getItems includeItemTypes=[.series] sortBy=[.sortName]`, paged to completion; hero = top backdrop-bearing, hero-eligible items | all series | terminal |

---

## 6. Kids (`BrunoKidsView`, GRID)

`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoKidsView.swift`. Merged kids libraries via
`BrunoCombinedLibrary`; one grid filtered in place by a pill row (debounced ~500 ms).

| Surface | Derived from | Max | Destination |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GRID** — All / Movies / TV Shows / Pixar / Disney | All merged kids items, filtered by `KidsFilter.matches` (type or studio; Disney excludes Pixar) | all filtered | rebuilt in place per filter |

---

## 7. Standalone grids reached by Show-all

| Surface (file) | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `brunoMoviesGrid` / `brunoTVGrid` → `BrunoMediaView` | A–Z full library by type | pushed COVER (own `BrunoCoverMenuBarRow`); lazy load on first appear |
| `brunoBoxSetGrid` → `BrunoBoxSetGridView` | static `items:` array passed by `brunoRouteToShowAll` | portrait/landscape, optional artCarousel/showsDate/collectionLabel; NOT paged |
| `brunoStudiosGrid` → `BrunoStudiosGridView` | static studio boxSets | cinematic 4-col landscape grid |
| `.library(ItemLibrary(parent:filters:))` | live paged Jellyfin query scoped to a boxSet, carrying `ItemFilterCollection` | the only path that carries a real server filter (years / sort) |

---

## 8. Show-all destination matrix — known mismatches & gaps

Routing is centralized, so true divergence comes from **different inputs to the same function** or from
**routes that drop a filter the inline shelf applied**. Flagged cases:

| # | Where | Inline shelf shows | Show-all lands on | Mismatch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Decades → Best of the {Decade}** (§3a) | significance-ordered top ≤15 (`bruno-sig`) | `ItemLibrary(decade)` **unfiltered, default sort** | Show-all drops the curation entirely — you get the whole decade, not "the best of." `gridYear=nil`, no sig filter. (`BrunoBoxSetShelvesView.swift:617-624`, `yearCategory :673`) |
| 2 | **Decades → Other** (§3a) | out-of-window/yearless subset | `ItemLibrary(decade)` unfiltered | "Other" Show-all yields the full decade, not just the Other bucket (no filter exists for it). |
| 3 | **Genre row (Movies / spine) vs Genre Show-all grid** | modern-only (years ≥ `modernCutoff`) | `ItemLibrary(genre, premiereDate desc)` — **all years** | Deliberate (owner: classics sink to bottom, not hidden), but the inline set ≠ grid set. Flag for de-dupe awareness, not a bug. (`BrunoHomePlan.genreQuery :330`; route `BrunoCategoryCardRow.swift:156`) |
| 4 | **Home spine "Browse by Director" / "Browse the Collection" / "Eras" tiles** | portrait tiles tapping into stock `.item` detail | Home has **no Show-all**; tiles route per item, NOT through `brunoRouteToShowAll` | The Home director/decade/collection *tiles* are item taps (BoxSet detail), whereas the **Collections-tab** Directors/Decades cards go through `brunoRouteToShowAll` to the grid/drill-in. Same concept, two different destinations depending on surface. |
| 5 | **Curated drill-in sub-collection Show-all** (§3b) vs **Curated tab card** | sub-collection preview | `ItemLibrary(curated boxSet)` no year filter | Curated never carries a year/era filter on Show-all, unlike Decades. Confirm this is intended (curated is hand-picked, so likely fine). |
| 6 | **Boxed Sets card → `.items`** vs other group cards → `.grid` | franchise boxSets | `brunoBoxSetGrid(category.children)` (landscape) | Boxed Sets routes off `category.children` while Directors/Studios route off the filtered `boxSetChildren`. Different code paths in `brunoRouteToShowAll` (`.items` `:73` vs `.grid` `:127`); verify Boxed Sets children never include the group itself. |

The **non-mismatches** worth recording (verified identical): a Director shelf header "Show all" and a
Director card tap both hit `.grid → brunoBoxSetGrid(portrait, artCarousel)` with the same
`boxSetChildren`; a Decade shelf header "Show all" and a Decades card both hit
`.shelves → brunoCategoryShelves(Decades)`. Per-year Decade Show-all **does** carry the year filter
(`gridYear=year`, mismatch #1 is only the "Best of" / "Other" buckets).

---

## 9. Open questions / unverified

| # | Question |
|---|---|
| 1 | Do the Collections / Movies / TV / Kids heroes auto-rotate like Home? Each passes a single `featured`/`items:[one]` to `BrunoHeroView`, suggesting **static** (Home is the only multi-item auto-advancing hero) — not confirmed against `BrunoHeroView.autoAdvanceEnabled`. |
| 2 | Boxed Sets (`.items`) Show-all: confirm `category.children` are all `.boxSet` and never include the parent group, so the landscape grid can't list the group itself. |
| 3 | "Best of the {Decade}" (mismatch #1): is dropping the significance order on Show-all intended, or should it route to a tag-filtered/sig-ordered library? Currently it cannot (Jellyfin has no `bruno-sig` server filter). |
| 4 | Home spine tiles (Eras/Auteurs/Collections) route to stock `.item` BoxSet detail, NOT to the branded drill-in surfaces the Collections tab uses for the same groups (mismatch #4). Is the divergence intended or a streamlining target? |
| 5 | Seasonal appears in Collections only Oct–Dec (`rank` window) but the Home explore tail can surface it year-round (date-aware keyword, seeded fallback). Confirm that asymmetry is desired. |
| 6 | `BrunoMediaView` A–Z grids (Movies fallback / TV / `brunoMoviesGrid` / `brunoTVGrid`) are reachable from multiple entry points (tab root, Movies "All Movies" pill, Home footer) — candidate for de-dup if the owner wants a single canonical "all movies" surface. |
