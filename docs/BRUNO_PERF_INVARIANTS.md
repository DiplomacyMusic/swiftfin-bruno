# Bruno tvOS — Performance Invariants

> **Read this before doing UX polish on the Home / browse shelves.**
>
> The Bruno tvOS Home is fast because of a handful of non-obvious rules. Most of them are invisible
> in the code unless you know to look. This doc is the contract: **what each rule is, why it exists,
> what breaks if you violate it, and how to make the change you want without violating it.**
>
> If you just want to restyle — see [Safe to touch](#safe-to-touch-restyle-freely) at the bottom. Most
> visual polish touches none of these invariants.
>
> **Sibling doc:** the **Movies tab is now the genre browse surface** — its interconnection + fragility map
> (menu-bar tab-root rule, the `"genres"` string contract, the three seeds, known gaps) lives in
> [`BRUNO_MOVIES_GENRE_SURFACE.md`](BRUNO_MOVIES_GENRE_SURFACE.md). Read that before touching the Movies tab.

The rules are anchored in code as `// INV-n:` comments at each load-bearing site. Grep `INV-` to find
them. The fragile *constants* live in one place — `BrunoShelfMetrics` (`Swiftfin tvOS/Views/BrunoHomeView/BrunoShelfMetrics.swift`)
— so you change a value once and every consumer follows.

## How Home loads (the mental model)

1. **Hero first.** `BrunoHomeViewModel` publishes the hero the moment it lands (~1–2s), so the banner
   paints while the shelves are still loading. The paint gate gives up the spinner as soon as the hero
   (or any shelf) exists.
2. **Shelves stream in, top-down.** All ~18 shelves load concurrently, but each is *revealed* only once
   every shelf above it has settled — so the spine fills downward and never shifts content under you.
3. **Instant relaunch.** The last session is persisted to disk (`BrunoHomeCache`). On relaunch Home
   paints that payload immediately, then revalidates from the network and reconciles in place.
4. **Posters pre-warm.** Each shelf warms its row's images so a revealed/scrolled row isn't blank.

Every one of those steps depends on the invariants below.

## The invariants

### INV-1 — Shelf rows are height-pinned (portrait AND landscape)
**What:** Every shelf row is pinned to a fixed height — `BrunoShelfMetrics.shelfRowHeight` (460,
portrait/7-col) or `BrunoShelfMetrics.landscapeShelfRowHeight` (348, landscape/4-col), via
`shelfRowHeight(for:)`. Sites: `BrunoShelfView`, `BrunoShelfRow`. **Landscape must be pinned too** —
leaving it at intrinsic height made landscape rows hard-snap (no intervening frames) on up-navigation.
**Why:** Two reasons, both load-bearing. (a) `CollectionHStack` computes its height lazily and reschedules
layout on the *next* runloop; if the `LazyVStack` re-reads that intrinsic height on a vertical focus move,
you get the up/down "hitch". (b) A constant spine geometry is what lets shelves stream in and reconcile
*under live focus* without shifting rows.
**Break symptom:** the vertical-scroll hitch returns; or shelves visibly shift/jump as they load or refresh.
**Safe change:** change the value in `BrunoShelfMetrics` (one place). Keep the placeholder/empty and loaded
states the *same* height. Don't make a row's height depend on its content.

### INV-2 — Shelf identity is stable and domain-derived
**What:** `ForEach` over shelves keys on `BrunoShelfViewModel.id` = `shelf.id` (a domain string like
`"genre-Western"`), never an array index, and it never changes across a shelf's loading→loaded→reconciled
life. Reconcile reuses the *same* VM instance for a matching id.
**Why:** the tvOS focus engine restores focus by view identity. Stable ids let us mutate the shelf array
(stream in, reconcile after relaunch) without tearing down rows — so focus survives.
**Break symptom:** focus jumps to a random shelf while content loads or after a background refresh.
**Safe change:** when you add/reorder shelves, keep ids derived from stable domain data. Never switch the
`ForEach` to `.enumerated()` / indices. Never rebuild a VM for an id that already exists on screen — update
its items in place (`BrunoShelfViewModel.hydrate(items:)`).

### INV-3 — The settled spine is deterministic and in plan order
**What:** Shelves are *revealed* in plan order and the final `sections` array is exactly plan order;
`shouldDisplay` / `seenDedupeKeys` are computed on that settled set. The plan (`BrunoHomePlan.build`) is pure
given `(seed, snapshot)`.
**Why:** "same seed ⇒ same home" is a product contract (`BrunoHomePlan.selfCheckPassed()` asserts it in
DEBUG). Revealing in completion order, or filtering on a transient set, breaks reproducibility.
**Break symptom:** home order flickers or differs run-to-run; the DEBUG self-check assert fires.
**Safe change:** if you touch the streaming code, keep the reveal append-only in plan order (see
`streamReveal`). Don't sort by completion time.
**Carve-out (Genres/Movies surface only):** the genre browse shelves (`BrunoBoxSetShelvesViewModel.performLoad`,
the Movies tab) intentionally reshuffle their *row order* per launch / every 6h (`rowOrderSeed`) so the
tab feels fresh — this sub-surface is deliberately NOT deterministic across launches. The seed is read
once per load, so order is stable within a session (no mid-session reorder; INV-7 safe). This carve-out
does NOT apply to the Home spine, which stays fully deterministic under the rule above.

### INV-4 — Prefetch width == cell width
**What:** The poster prefetcher requests the *same* image width as the poster cell: `portrait 200 /
landscape 300, quality 90`, sourced from `BrunoShelfMetrics`. Those mirror the **stock-private** constants in
`Shared/Components/PosterImage.swift`.
**Why:** the Nuke cache key is salted by `maxWidth`. Warm a different width and you populate a *different*
key — the cell still misses, and you've wasted bandwidth.
**Break symptom:** prefetch silently does nothing; revealed shelves are blank for a beat anyway.
**Gotcha:** `Swiftfin tvOS/Components/PosterButton.swift` declares its own `…MaxWidth = 500` — those are
**dead/unused**. The width that actually hits the wire is `PosterImage`'s 200/300. Mirror PosterImage, not
PosterButton.
**Safe change:** if you change poster display size, update `BrunoShelfMetrics` to match whatever width
`PosterImage` ends up requesting. Both the cell and the prefetcher read from there.
**Genre browse surface (resolved):** the prewarm is now wired on **both** the Home shelf row
(`BrunoShelfView`) and the shared browse row (`BrunoShelfRow`, used by the genre/Movies tab + Collections),
each warming at the cell width (portrait 200) `.onAppear` / cancelling `.onDisappear`. See
[`BRUNO_MOVIES_GENRE_SURFACE.md`](BRUNO_MOVIES_GENRE_SURFACE.md) §8 G6.

### INV-5 — The disk item-cache is seed-keyed and source-restricted
**What:** `BrunoHomeCache` persists: the library snapshot, the hero *superset pool*, and realized items for
`.query` shelves only — stamped with the day-stable `seed` and `userID`. It **never** persists
`.resume` / `.nextUp` / `.recentlyAdded` (live user-state) or the 5 random hero picks.
**Why:** the day-stable seed means a cached spine is still valid later the same day. But Shuffle reseeds → new
`shelf.id`s → the seed guard makes the old payload a clean miss. Live rows carry `userData` (watched/resume) —
a stale "Continue Watching" is a *correctness* bug, not just stale art. The hero is intentionally random per
entry, so only its pool is durable.
**Break symptom:** Shuffle shows yesterday's shelves; or "Continue Watching" shows finished/removed items;
or the hero looks frozen on the same 5.
**Safe change:** keep `(seed, shelf.id)` as the item-cache key. If you add a new shelf source that is
user-state-dependent, exclude it from `persistPayload` (treat it like `.resume`). Persist pools, not picks.

### INV-6 — Ambient background is a sibling layer at low resolution
**What:** `BrunoAmbientBackground` is a sibling `ZStack` layer (not a `ScrollView` `.background`) and requests
`maxWidth: 480`. It's one fixed backdrop, not the rotating one.
**Why:** a radius-90 blur in the scroll view's `.background` re-rasterizes every scroll frame. As a sibling it
stays out of the per-frame compositing path. 480px is visually identical once blurred + 50% opacity, for ~7×
less decode.
**Break symptom:** scroll-frame stutter returns; memory/decode spikes.
**Safe change:** restyle the ambient freely (color, opacity, gradient) but keep it a sibling layer and keep
the decode small. Don't bind it to the rotating hero backdrop.

### INV-7 — Focus lands on the hero until a real shelf exists
**What:** On first paint the hero is the first focusable element; focus rests there while shelves are still
streaming in. Shelves only become focusable once they carry real content (they don't render until
`items.isNotEmpty`).
**Why:** if focus could land on an empty/placeholder card that then fills with art, the art appears to
"change under the ring" — unsettling on a 10-ft screen.
**Break symptom:** the focus ring sits on a blank/loading card and the poster swaps beneath it.
**Safe change:** if you add a skeleton/placeholder row, make it **non-focusable** until it has real items.
Keep the hero as the natural first-focus target.

### INV-8 — Reveal cadence is top-down regardless of completion order
**What:** Shelves are loaded in parallel but revealed strictly top-down (`streamReveal` flushes consecutive
completed shelves). The hero's auto-advance is held (`autoAdvanceEnabled`) until the spine has settled.
**Why:** revealing in completion order makes the page twinkle (random pop-in) and can insert a shelf *above*
the one you're looking at. A held auto-advance keeps a backdrop swap from competing with the fill. Together
they read as an intentional cinematic stagger, not "still loading."
**Break symptom:** shelves pop in out of order / content jumps; or the hero rotates while the page is still
assembling.
**Safe change:** keep the reveal append-only and ordered. Tune the fade/stagger/drift in `BrunoHomeView`
(the `.transition` + `.animation(value:)`) freely — that's cosmetic. Keep auto-advance gated on settle.

### INV-9 — Every reveal animation honors reduce-motion
**What:** The shelf stream-in fade+drift, the scroll-reset animation, and the hero drift all collapse to an
instant state when `accessibilityReduceMotion` is on.
**Why:** accessibility contract (and the design spec mandates it).
**Break symptom:** motion plays for users who asked for none.
**Safe change:** any new entrance/transition you add must branch on `reduceMotion` (it's already an
`@Environment` in `BrunoHomeView`). Collapse to opacity-only or instant.

## Safe to touch (restyle freely)

None of these go near the invariants — change them without ceremony:

- Poster **corner radius, shadow, focus ring, hover/scale** styling.
- Shelf **eyebrow / title** text, font, tracking, color (Oswald + accent).
- **Spacing rhythm** between shelves and within headers (the 8/10/16/40 system).
- Hero **scrim** gradients, copy, pill styling, meta line.
- **Colors and fonts** (the `Color.bruno.*` / `brunoDisplay`/`brunoBody` tokens).
- The **stream-in animation** itself — fade duration, drift distance, stagger feel (keep INV-9).
- The **"Show all" card** look in `BrunoShelfRow`.

If a change touches a `// INV-n` site, re-read that invariant here first. When in doubt, the safe move is
almost always: **keep row height fixed, keep shelf ids stable, and read widths/heights from
`BrunoShelfMetrics`.**
